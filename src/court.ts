// those twelve files and a card you can put on a table, and none of it is
// guesswork: the numbers below were measured off the source by web-nert's
// tools/render-face-art.py, which baked them to WebP. This is the same
// pipeline with the baking taken out, so a palette can be chosen while the
// game is running rather than only while it is being built.
//
// The baked decks were 84 files and 4.1MB, and are gone: twelve sources gzip
// to about 490kB and cover every palette there will ever be, where seven
// directories of WebP covered exactly the seven somebody thought of.
//
// Nothing here touches a canvas - it is string and rectangle arithmetic, and
// it is in the Phaser-free half of the package on purpose.

 *
 * `ruleWipe`: the source clips each figure to a border rule at y 0.054, and
 * that rule doubles as the top edge of every crown, hat and sword in the
 * deck. Cropping below it decapitates all twelve. So the crop starts above
 * the rule and the rule itself gets painted out.

 * rule. Between the rule at x 0.042 and the garment at 0.081 the source
 * leaves a white margin, and cropping at the rule carries that margin into
 * the art as a pale strip down the side of every court. Measured just above
 * the seam, where the figure is widest: 0.081 to 0.919 on all twelve, with
 * both edges set a hair inside so the garment bleeds off rather than stopping
 * on the card.
 *
 * `indexBox`: the source's own rank and its big decorative pip, painted out
 * because the board draws its own index over the top. Cropping in from the
 * left to dodge it does not work - the index sits directly above the
 * shoulder, so any window narrow enough to miss it also cuts off the crown.
