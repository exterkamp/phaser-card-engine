 * The stock a deck is printed on, and the two inks on it.

 * Until now every deck was near-white paper with the package's own red and
 * black, and a theme was only its court palette and its back. That was fine
 * while the seven were seven printings of one deck. It stops being fine the
 * moment a deck is meant to be a screen rather than a card: a phosphor deck
 * on white paper is a green deck, not a terminal.
 *
 * So a theme now names all three. Most still name what they always had -
 * `PAPER` and the package's default inks - and say so by naming them rather
 * than by being absent, because a deck that is deliberately white and a deck
 * that forgot to say are different things and only one of them is a bug.
 *
 * `red` and `black` are what the suits are *printed in*, not what they
 * *count as*. Matrix draws its hearts in amber and its spades in green, and
 * every rule that asks still gets red and black back - see ink.ts, which is
 * where that distinction lives.
