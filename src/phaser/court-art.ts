// them: run the twelve sources through a renderer at build time, once per
// palette, and ship the WebP. That is faster to start, and it was 84 files
// and 4.1MB. What it cannot do is a palette nobody thought of - a game with
// its own colors has to go and rebuild the art - and that is the whole of
// why this replaced it.
//
// Measured, on the twelve at 480px, outside a scene: 280ms on a desktop and
// about a second on a mid-range phone. Inside a running scene it is roughly
// three times that, for the reason in renderCourts below. Either way it is
// once per palette - they are cached in the texture manager afterwards - and
// the recolor is only 12ms of it. The rasterising is the cost, so the same
// palette at two sizes costs twice.
