// The court painter's worker.
//
// Painting a court is a decode, a draw of the decoded SVG onto a page, a
// handful of fills, a crop, and - on a deck whose stock differs from its
// highlight - a flood fill over every pixel. All of it is main-thread work when
// done in the page, and it lands in the same frames as whatever the game is
// animating. This moves the draw, the fills, the crop and the flood off it.
//
// What cannot move is the decode: `new Image()` needs a document. So the page
// decodes the SVG, hands the browser's own rasteriser the resize
// (`createImageBitmap`, asynchronous and off-thread in every browser that has
// OffscreenCanvas), and transfers the bitmap here. What comes back is a bitmap
// of the finished crop, which the page blits onto a canvas and gives to
// Phaser - the texture is the same kind of texture as before.
//
// The worker has no file of its own. A package that is compiled with tsc and
// consumed by whatever bundler the game uses cannot count on that bundler
// knowing how to emit a worker out of node_modules, so the worker is built at
// run time from the source text of the one function that is its whole body,
// and started from a blob: URL. The price is that `courtWorkerBody` has to be
// self-contained, which court-pixels.ts is already for the same reason. Where
// a page forbids blob workers, starting one fails and painting falls back.
