/**
 * A suit vocabulary: the four standard ones plus whatever a game has added.

 * Suits a game invents are the game's, not this package's. An earlier version

 * two consumers has one, which made every other consumer carry a suit it has
 * never heard of, and made that consumer's suit something it had to ask
 * permission to add.
 *
 * So the extra suits are declared where they are used, with the colour their
 * rules should treat them as, and what comes back is a small object that
 * knows about them:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // in the game, not here
 * export const SUITS_IN_PLAY = defineSuits({ star: { colour: 'black' } });
 * export type CardSuit = SuitOf<typeof SUITS_IN_PLAY>;   // Suit | 'star'
 *
 * SUITS_IN_PLAY.colourOf('star');     // 'black' - what the tableau asks
 * SUITS_IN_PLAY.isStandard('star');   // false - this is what "special" meant
 * ```
 *
 * A colour is required rather than optional because the question this
 * package cannot answer for you is exactly that one. Nertz's star is printed
 * in gold and plays as black; a game wanting a suit that is genuinely
 * neither says `{ colour: 'gold' }` and gets false from both isRed and
 * isBlack, which is the answer that stops a red-and-black rule quietly
 * swallowing it.
 *
 * A value rather than a registry with a register() on it, and that is
 * deliberate: a module-level registry has to be written to before anything
 * reads it, which is an ordering problem in the app and a shared-state problem
 * in its tests. This is just a constant a game exports.
