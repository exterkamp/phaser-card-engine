// The primitive every card game on a table needs and none of them share: a
// named place with a position, which cards land on and build up from. A
// foundation is one. So is a stock, a waste, a free cell, a tableau column, a
// peak position, a reserve, and the hole in the middle of Black Hole. Between
// two games there are eleven kinds of pile and they are all this.
//
// It is geometry and nothing else - no Phaser, no sprites, no scene. That is
// deliberate rather than incidental: where the sixth card of a squeezed fan
// sits is arithmetic, and arithmetic that needs a browser to be tested is
// arithmetic that does not get tested. What a renderer adds is drawing the
// card at the point this hands it. See the demo.

/**
 * Which end of a stack is drawn on top of the rest.
 *
 * Not geometry - every card sits in exactly the same place either way - but
 * the difference between a pile you can read and one you cannot, because it
 * decides *which edge of each card the one above it covers*.
 *
 * A card carries its index in its top-left corner, so the edge left showing
 * is the whole question:
 *
 * | fan | last-on-top shows | first-on-top shows |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | down | each card's top edge - **the index** | each card's bottom edge |
 * | up | each card's bottom edge | each card's top edge - **the index** |
 * | right | each card's left edge - **the index** | each card's right edge |
 * | left | each card's right edge | each card's left edge - **the index** |
 * | none | the newest card | the oldest card |
 *
 * So a tableau fanning down wants last-on-top and the same tableau fanning up
 * wants first-on-top, and a pile that gets this backwards is a column of
 * blank slivers with one readable card at the end. `readableOrder` below
 * answers it for you.
 *
 * The other half is squared piles, where it is not about legibility at all: a
 * waste shows the card you just turned (last) and a face-down stock shows the
 * card you will turn next (first, near enough) - and a deck whose top card is
 * the bottom of the pile is a deck that deals from the wrong end.
