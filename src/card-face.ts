// Three faces, because a card is laid out for the thing it is read on.
//
//   mobile    a large index with its suit beside it in the top-left, one big
//             suit filling the rest, and no second corner at all
//   standard  the card as it is printed: rank over suit in two opposite
//             corners, and a true count of pips in the classic arrangement
//   jumbo     the same, with indices at roughly twice the size - the deck
//             sold for players who cannot read a standard one across a table
//
// `mobile` is Nertz's, which is the one of the two games that had thought
// hardest about a card seen four at a time on a phone: once a card is legible
// at a glance the second index is redundant, and dropping it is what paid for
// everything else being bigger. It is still the default for that reason.
//
// What the other two buy is the thing `mobile` gave up. A standard card tells
// you its rank twice, from either end, so a hand held fanned either way round
// reads - and its pips are a count rather than a symbol, which is the only
// version of a card where a seven and a nine differ by something other than a
// digit. At small sizes that is a worse card. At the size a card is actually
// dealt on a table it is the right one.
//
// Here rather than in the sprite so it can be checked without a browser. The
// sprite is fifteen setPosition calls against these numbers; the numbers are
// the part that can be wrong in a way nobody notices until a card is fanned
// under another one.
