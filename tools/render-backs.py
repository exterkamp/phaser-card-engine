"""Draws the card backs this package ships.

One file per deck, at assets/cards/art/<theme>/back.webp, and nothing else:
the twelve courts are rendered from their SVG sources at runtime - see
src/phaser/court-art.ts - so a back is the only picture of a card left in
this repo.

The drawing is lifted from web-nert's tools/render-face-art.py, which is
where these backs were baked before the two games shared a package. The
court half of that script has no job here and did not come with it.

A back is ink on transparency, with nothing opaque behind it. The colour
under it is the player's, not the deck's - in Nertz that is how you tell
whose row you are looking at, and here it is simply the colour of your
deck. So a green ink for a green deck would be a back that vanishes on a
green card: what varies per deck is the geometry - field, pitch, medallion,
border - which is legible over any of them, and the ink only ever shifts
its tint a little without leaving light.

Run from the repo root, with Pillow installed:
